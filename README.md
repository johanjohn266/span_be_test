# span_BE_test
This is my assessment challenge that is completed in Python. The main.py contains the code used for the challenge while test_automate.py is the code for the automated testing. The example.txt is the textfile that is used in the given example input while the other textfiles present are used in the automated testing. 

Please note these files all need to be present in the same directory to run.

# Usage

The program can be executed using a textfile with the relevant input by running the following command on the CLI

``` 
python main.py <filename> 
```
  
The automated tests can be run in the CLI by two ways

1.Calling pytest and the testing file

``` 
pytest test-automate.py  
```

2.Calling the main file without adding an input

``` 
python main.py 
```
